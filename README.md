### What is OK Report?
  Ok Report is a virtual waiting room bringing family and loved ones together in a time of need. It is an elegant solution for sharing real-time updates about a patient who is in a hospital with distant family members.
  <br/>
  It aims to ease the process of storing and accessing the vitals of patients admitted to the ICU.



### What was the need of developing OK Report ?
People are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) because their illness or injuries may be life-threatening and they need intense support while they are being treated, constant monitoring and nursing care that cannot be performed on general wards. Patients stay in ICU for varying lengths of time, depending on the nature of the illness, and during much of this time they may be sedated or unconscious.
<br/>
The everyday lives of family and close friends may come to an abrupt halt or be turned upside down as they live in the uncertainty of not knowing whether the patient will survive.
<br/>
With Ok Report you’ll be able to get a detailed report of the patient's daily conditions and treatments.


### Topics Covered 
 • When a patient is finished with surgery or when they are being released or maybe served with a meal, the family member gets updated.
 • Patient's current stats include his/her Blood Pressure, Pulse, Spo2 level, Body Temperature, etc are being provided to his/her distant family members
